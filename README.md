## Installation

### 1. üì• Download the Script

Clone or download this repository to your computer.

### 2. üìÇ Add to Server Resources

Move the downloaded folder to the `resources` directory of your FiveM server.

### 3. üõ†Ô∏è Update `server.cfg`

- Open your `server.cfg` file, located in your server's main directory.
- Add `ensure ved-demise` to ensure the script starts with your server.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note for ESX Users

If you're using the **default ESX progress bar**, you must add the following export to support progress bar state checks:

Add this code to the end of **`Progress.lua`**:
```lua
exports("IsProgressActive", function()
    return CurrentProgress ~= nil
end)
```
If you're not using the default ESX progress bar, ensure your custom progress bar includes:

- An export to check if the progress bar is active.

- An export to cancel the progress bar if needed.

## Configurations

Everything in this script is fully customizable through the `config.lua` file. I‚Äôve added clear and detailed comments for every setting to make customization easy, even if you have no coding experience. Make sure to check the [config.lua](https://github.com/vedrion/ved-demise/blob/main/config.lua) file to explore all available options and adjust the script exactly how you want.
